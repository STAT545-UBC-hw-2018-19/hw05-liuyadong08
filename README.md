# This is the github repository of STAT545 Homework 05
In this repository, there will be a list of fies.
* README.md
* a gapminder_files folder that stores all the images
* a gap_2002.csv file
* a gapminder.Rmd file
* a gapminder.html file
* a gapminder.md file
* a gapminder.nb.html file
* a gdpPercap_reorder_correct.png file
* a gdpPercap_reorder_wrong.png file
* a gdpPercap_title.pdf file

Since the .html file is too large for github to show, and the .md file cannot show all the plotly plots, I published the report on RPubs.com, and the link is http://rpubs.com/yadong_liu/431086 Please look at this one!
